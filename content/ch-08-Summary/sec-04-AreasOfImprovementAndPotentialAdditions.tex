\begin{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{User Interface Enhancements:} Continuous feedback from users can be instrumental in refining the user interface, making it more intuitive and user-friendly.

    \item \textbf{Expansion of AI Capabilities:} Beyond the current AI features, further integration of AI can be explored, such as predictive analytics for issue trends or sentiment analysis on user comments to gauge overall community sentiment.

    \item \textbf{Integration with Other Civic Systems:} To provide a more comprehensive view of city issues, potential integrations with other civic systems like traffic management or public transport can be considered.

    \item \textbf{Enhanced Security Measures:} While the application already has robust security measures in place, the ever-evolving nature of cyber threats necessitates continuous updates and refinements in security protocols.

    \item \textbf{Community Engagement Features:} Introducing features like community forums or user polls can foster a sense of community and allow users to discuss and prioritize issues collaboratively.

    \item \textbf{Customizability:} Providing users, especially administrators, with tools to customize certain features or visual aspects of the application can further tailor the user experience to individual preferences.

\end{enumerate}
